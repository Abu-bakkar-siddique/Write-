    1. NOT everyone is on the platform to edit docs, majority of the audience is there to read the articles, that are reviewed and written
    with collaboration of experts.

    2. Joining a group to edit a doc is a big deal, it must not be easy for everyone to hop in.

    ## ROLES AND PERMISSIONS

        - Classroom Moderators(creator is the first mod, may select other users as mods)
        - Document maintainer (normally the creator of the document, but the creator may decide to add another user as the maintainer)
        - Document Editors (A group of peeple who are allowed by the permission of the maintainer to edit the document)
        FLOW:
            After making changes, the editors can create a sort of 'pull request' for the maintainer(s) to accept(or reject) and 'merge'
            into the main document.

    ## CLASSROOMS
        - Each Classroom will have certain tags(subjects), a 'motive' written in fewest possible words describing exactly what the users 
        discuss in there.

        - Each Classroom will have a reputaion score, (simply some sort of votes system).

        - An Open feed where a articles(documents) that are complete are published and displayed in the feed(same goes here, comments, upvotes
        sharing in other Classroom and with friends).

        - Moderators can set rules:
            In chat interviews with the users who want to join a classroom
            Set criteria, having certain number of upvotes, Education, number of articles published.

        - Withen each classroom a user can work on ONLY one article at once to keep things narrow focused BUT can read others.
        - The article user is working on will be displayed on thier profile

        - some classrooms will be SPECIFIC to a discussion that is the 'document' that the members are working on, the owner/creator/Moderators
          of the group may decide to conclude the document and dismantle the group with auto publication of the document OR set a pole 
          for the document conclusion and being published to the general feed.

        - upvotes
        - pin messages 
        
        - (This feature is optional for the mods to enable)Each user has a limit to how many messages they can share(given by the mods or by reputaion).
        this is to make sure that whatever is said is meaningful and relevent and there is no fuck around in chat.

        - Implement a **progressive message limit** where new users have a restricted number of messages, but the limit increases based on contributions.  
        - Allow moderators to **manually upgrade** users to "unlimited mode" if they prove their credibility.  
        - Introduce a **peer or moderator approval system** where meaningful messages increase a user's limit over time.  
        - Make the message limit an **optional feature** that moderators can enable or disable per discussion room.
        - mods can set a user to reader-only
